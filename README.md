# words

This is a collection of US English words in lower-case in various formats. 

The root contains a words_raw.txt file which was the initial source.  Each folder, named for its format, contains a singular "all" file as well as separate files organized by character-count i.e., "words_04.\*" contains only words with 4 characters.  These files have been cleaned up to exclude any words containing characters outside the standard 26 character US Englishlowercase alphabet.  It has not been vetted for appropriateness of words contained within, so please do be sure to do so for your purposes if you choose to use them.  In the future, I may update this to include versions scrubbed of swear words and the like.
